    "The Monty Hall problem is a well-known probability puzzle named after the host of the TV game show ”Let’s Make a Deal.” Here’s the premise: Behind three doors, there are two goats and a car. The host knows what’s behind each door, but the contestant does not. The contestant selects one door, and then the host opens one of the remaining doors, revealing a goat. Now, the contestant is offered the opportunity to change their initial choice. Would you stick with your first pick, or would you switch? It’s a counterintuitive problem with a surprising solution. You can read more about it in this [wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monty_Hall_problem) article: . In this mini-project, you’ll be\n",
