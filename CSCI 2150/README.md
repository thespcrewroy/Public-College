## Course Objectives
This course is designed for students in Science and
Engineering. It will offer students a basic but solid background in numerical simulation
for solving scientific problems. Students will learn to use MATLAB and/or other
available symbolic and numerical computation software throughout the course. The
course will cover essentially the main topics mentioned above.

## Learning Outcomes
This course presents topics in mathematics that are most
relevant to students studying science and engineering. At the end of the semester, all
students will be able to do the following: 
1. Use matlab for manipulating matrices.
2. Use matlab/maple for symbolic computation, such as finding the Taylor series of a function
and evaluate its value at a certain point
3. Distinguish the difference between the
representation of floating point and integer numbers in the computer memory.
4. Distinguish between single and double precision representations of floating-point
numbers and compute errors when floating point operations are involved.
5. Compare between numerical and exact solution and validate the results.
6. Solve linear system of equations using Gaussian elimination and available software.
7. Find the roots of a nonlinear function and examine its correctness.
8. Interpolate a table of values by using polynomials.
